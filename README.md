# Prime-drawing

Hey guys,

This is a simple C program using SDL that creates a "Prime spiral" of "Ulam spiral", a grid of the first NxN natural numbers and sets them up.
in a spiral,puttign the prime numbers as black dots. (I suggest you google it if you don't know what I'm talking about)

There is an example for a 2500x2500 grid, and also a compiled version of the program that should work on any windows computer
(not sure about other OS).

To use the generator, simply open a command line in the location you have downloaded the .exe (or re-compiled), and type

"Prime drawing" N

where N is the side legnth of the resulting picture, i.e. the first NxN numbers will be analysed.

Have fun with it !
